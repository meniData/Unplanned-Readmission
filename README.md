# Creating the list of ICUSTAYs for Unplanned Readmission prediction
### This repository contains a notebook with the necessary code for reproducing the full list of ICUSTAYs that are relevant for Unplanned Readmission predction, as described in our paper:
### [Predicting Unplanned Readmissions in the Intensive Care Unit: A Multimodality Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08139). 
#### Full instructions for accessing MIMIC data can be found at: https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/gettingstarted/. <br> Note that access to MIMIC-III data is a prerequisite for using the code provided in the notebook.
